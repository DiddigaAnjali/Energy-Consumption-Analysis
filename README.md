 ## Business Problem

Governments and international energy organizations manage extensive datasets related to energy production, consumption, emissions, population, and economic performance. Analyzing these datasets is essential to understand how energy usage evolves over time and how it relates to economic growth and environmental impact. This project uses SQL-based analysis to examine energy trends, compare countries fairly using per-capita and ratio-based metrics, and support data-driven decision-making for sustainable energy planning.

## Objectives

Analyze global energy consumption patterns across regions and sectors.

Identify long-term trends and key drivers influencing energy usage.

Compare renewable and non-renewable energy consumption worldwide.

Assess the environmental and economic impacts of current energy usage.

Support policy development and strategic planning through data-driven insights.

## Key Insights

Global emissions continue to rise, driven largely by increasing energy demand.

CO₂-based energy sources remain the dominant contributors to total emissions.

Economic growth and energy consumption show a strong positive correlation across major economies.

Population growth is closely associated with higher total emissions, particularly in rapidly developing regions.

## Conclusion

Population growth and economic expansion continue to drive global increases in energy consumption and emissions. A relatively small number of countries contribute a disproportionate share of total emissions. However, cross-country comparisons indicate that it is possible to decouple economic growth from environmental impact through improved energy efficiency, cleaner technologies, and sustainable policy frameworks. This analysis highlights the importance of data-driven strategies in achieving long-term energy security and environmental sustainability.
